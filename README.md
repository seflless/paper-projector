# Paper Projector
Exploring streaming paper that is being drawn on as in a video call.

## Live Demo
This [live demo](https://seflless.github.io/paper-projector/perspective-tv.html) dewarps the content of a monitor shot from a mobile phone.

## Requirements
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
 - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Usage

```
git clone
cd paper-projector
yarn
yarn video
```

## Todo
Add support for streaming the camera feed of a phone to another device for dewarping, this way you set your phone anywhere to create a 
projected space that you can then run computer vision on from a desktop web app. So take a look at something like
[npmjs.com/simple-peer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-peer) to easily use WebRTC for the video streaming.
